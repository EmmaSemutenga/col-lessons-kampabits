Python enables programs to be written compactly and readably. Programs written in Python are typically much shorter than equivalent C, C++, or Java programs, for several reasons:

-the high-level data types allow you to express complex operations in a single statement;
-statement grouping is done by indentation instead of beginning and ending brackets;
-no variable or argument declarations are necessary.
